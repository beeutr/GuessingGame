# GuessingGame
# Hi, my name is Uyen tran and I graduated with a Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering
# This is a simple guessing game I made during my undergrad when I took CSE 142 - Java Programming I
# Source code is available as GuessingGame.java, including main and other methods I wrote
# If you want to play the game withouth an IDE, refer to these steps:

1. Make sure that your PC uses a Windowns OS. The game will not work with a Mac OS because I haven't tested on Mac yet ðŸ˜¢
2. Make sure that you have Java installed on your PC (very very important ðŸ«¶)
3. Install "GuessingGame.jar". This is an executable jar file. I have tried to convert this into a .exe file but it failed to load on my PC.
   Still trying to figure out how to fix this to reduce unecessary steps in starting up the game
4. Open your Command Prompt. Navigate to the search bar of your PC (or file search) and type "cmd". It will direct to the internal command 
   prompt
5. Locate your "GuessingGame.jar" file and get your file path. Usually if you download a file, it will be under the "Downloads" folder.
6.You can get the file path (if it's under Downloads) as \Downloads\GuessingGame.jar
7. On the Command Prompt, type in "java -jar yourfilepath.jar". Replace yourfile path with the actual file path of the GuessingGame.jar file
   For example. java -jar \Downloads\GuessingGame.jar
8. Press Enter and enjoy the game ðŸ˜„
